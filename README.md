# F1-Championship-
An Artificial Neural Network Project which will produce the final podium standings of the racers. This is a time series project which is build on multiple Datasets


ðŸ“Œ Features

Preprocessing of multiple F1 datasets (drivers, constructors, races, results, standings).

Feature engineering to capture driver, constructor, and race dynamics.

ANN model to predict driver/constructor performance.

Interactive input: provide driver/constructor details â†’ get predicted standings.

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Loss, Visualization of predictions.

Model Details

Architecture: Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

Input Features: Driver stats, constructor stats, race details, past performance.

Output: Predicted championship standings (driver & constructor).

Optimizer: Adam.

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy / MSE (depending on task).

Results

Model achieves promising accuracy in predicting driver/constructor standings.

Shows meaningful correlations with real-world F1 outcomes.
